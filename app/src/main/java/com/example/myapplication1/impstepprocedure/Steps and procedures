For xml design
1. always add constrain layout in every activity fragment,cardview, etc for better layout configuration
2. always add kotlin extension and data binding first
3. use data binding in every layout

For recycler view
1. if data binding is added in recycler view then use
-    class ViewHolder(val binding: ItemlistloandataBinding) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(binding.root) {}
2. remember always give click events in adapter class(in viewHolder or create view holder) of that activity
-      btDismiss.setOnClickListener {
                    customDialog.dismiss()
                }
3. adapter class is always 90% same for every class
4. always set adapter in the activity

Retrofit Api call
1. always check the sent data is similar to interface data ex. Call<List<DataModel>>
